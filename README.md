## Project Summary

### Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop a time series forecasting model to predict daily sales for Rossmann stores. By leveraging historical sales data and various store attributes, this project aims to create an accurate predictive model to assist in business planning and inventory management.

### Project Objectives
- **Data Retrieval and Processing:** Extract and preprocess sales data from the Rossmann Stores dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze sales trends and patterns to gain insights.
- **Feature Engineering:** Develop relevant features to enhance model performance.
- **Model Development:** Implement and optimize a time series forecasting model, with an initial focus on LSTM due to its effectiveness in capturing sequential patterns.
- **Performance Metrics:** Achieve a model performance with at least 0.80 R-squared.
- **Documentation:** Document the entire process including data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- **Presentation:** Clearly and effectively present the findings.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Sales vs. Customers:** Shows a positive correlation between the number of customers and sales. High variability in sales is observed with increasing customer numbers.
- **Sales per Day:** Indicates strong seasonality and variability in sales, with notable peaks and troughs.
- **Customers per Day:** Highlights regular patterns and seasonal trends in customer numbers.
- **Sales per Customer:** Sales per customer show cyclical patterns with consistent overall trends.
- **Sales per Week:** Weekly sales fluctuate, with some high-sales weeks particularly noticeable.
- **Weekday Sales:** Monday has the highest average sales, with a mid-week dip and an increase towards the weekend.
- **Locality:** Store Type B shows the highest average sales, with other types having similar but lower sales.
- **Seasonality:** Monthly sales vary widely with no consistent trend, but some months show significantly higher sales.
- **Promotions:** Promotions lead to higher sales and increased variability.

### Model Training
- **Dependencies:** Ensure all required libraries (e.g., numpy, pandas, scikit-learn) are installed.
- **Random Forest Model:** Utilized for forecasting, with considerations for regularization and cross-validation to prevent overfitting and ensure robust performance.
- **Performance:** Initial training showed low training loss but higher validation loss, indicating potential overfitting. Adjustments were made to improve generalization.
- **Forecasting:** Added functionality to predict future sales for up to 42 days and saved results to CSV files and PNG plots for visualization.

### EDA on Forecast Results
- **Total Forecast Sales by Day:** Graphs the forecasted sales over time.
- **Average Forecast Sales by Week:** Shows average sales forecast per week.

### Summary of Findings
- **Store Type Performance:** Store Type B is the top performer in sales volume and customer traffic.
- **Sales and Customer Correlation:** Strong correlation between sales and customer numbers.
- **Effectiveness of Promotions:** Promotions significantly boost sales and customer counts.
- **Impact of School Holidays:** Higher sales are achieved during school holidays compared to regular days.
- **Holiday Analysis:** Peak sales during Christmas and increased store operations during school holidays.
- **Competition Insights:** The presence of competition is indicated by non-null competition distance values, even if other related data is missing.
