                <!-- Random Forest Summary -->
                <h2>Random Forest Overview</h2>
                <p><strong>What is Random Forest?</strong><br>
                Random Forest is a versatile and widely used machine-learning algorithm developed by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler. It combines the outputs of multiple decision trees to achieve a single, more accurate result. Random Forest is effective for both classification and regression tasks due to its robustness and flexibility.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Decision Trees</strong><br>
                Random Forest is built on decision trees, which are simple models that make decisions by asking a series of questions. Each decision tree splits data based on features, ultimately leading to a prediction at the leaf nodes. Decision trees can suffer from issues like bias and overfitting, but combining many such trees helps in mitigating these problems.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Ensemble Methods</strong><br>
                Random Forest is an ensemble method that uses bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) and feature randomness. Bagging involves training multiple models on random samples of data and averaging their predictions to reduce variance. Feature randomness ensures that each tree in the forest is trained on a different subset of features, further improving accuracy and reducing correlation among trees.</p>
                
                <p><strong>How It Works</strong><br>
                The Random Forest algorithm involves three main hyperparameters: node size, number of trees, and number of features sampled. Each tree in the forest is trained on a bootstrap sample of the data, and feature bagging introduces additional randomness. Predictions are made by averaging the outputs of all trees (for regression) or by majority voting (for classification). The out-of-bag (OOB) samples are used for cross-validation.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Benefits</strong><br>
                Random Forest offers several advantages:
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduced risk of overfitting due to averaging of multiple uncorrelated trees.</li>
                    <li>High flexibility for both classification and regression tasks.</li>
                    <li>Ease of determining feature importance, which helps in understanding model contributions.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                
                <p><strong>Challenges</strong><br>
                Despite its benefits, Random Forest has some challenges:
                <ul>
                    <li>Can be time-consuming and resource-intensive due to the large number of trees.</li>
                    <li>Complex to interpret compared to a single decision tree.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                
                <p><strong>Applications</strong><br>
                Random Forest is used across various industries:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Finance:</strong> For evaluating credit risk, detecting fraud, and pricing options.</li>
                    <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> For tasks like gene expression classification, biomarker discovery, and predicting drug responses.</li>
                    <li><strong>E-commerce:</strong> For recommendation engines and cross-selling.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The most selling and crowded store type is B.</li>
                            <li>Sales are highly correlated with the number of Customers.</li>
                            <li>For all stores, promotions lead to an increase in both Sales and Customers.</li>
                            <li>Stores open during School Holidays have more sales than on normal days.</li>
                            <li>More stores are open during School holidays than State holidays.</li>
                            <li>Sales increase during Christmas week, likely because people buy more beauty products for Christmas celebrations.</li>
                            <li>The absence of values in features like CompetitionOpenSinceYear/Month doesnâ€™t indicate a lack of competition, as CompetitionDistance values are not null where the other two values are null.</li>
                            <li>After analyzing sales using Fourier decomposition, there appears to be a slight seasonality component in the Sales data.</li>
                            <li>Saturdays are a popular day for shoppers in terms of days of the week, potentially because Rossman stores are closed on Sundays </li>
